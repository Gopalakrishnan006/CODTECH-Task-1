###OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project: Cyber security and ethical hacking

Project Objective:
To develop a tool that assesses the strength of passwords entered by users. The tool will analyze various factors including length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide feedback on the strength of the password and suggest improvements if necessary.

Project Components:

1.Password Analysis Function:
A core function (check_password_strength) that evaluates a password based on predefined criteria.
Criteria include length, use of different character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters), avoidance of common patterns, and uniqueness.

2.Scoring System:
Assigns a score based on the analysis to quantify the strength of the password.
Provides a qualitative assessment ("Weak", "Moderate", "Strong") based on the score.

3.Feedback Mechanism:
Provides specific feedback to the user on how to improve their password.
Identifies shortcomings in the password based on the analysis criteria.

Detailed Components:

1.Password Analysis Function:

Length Check:
Password should be at least 8 characters long.
Additional points for passwords 12 characters or longer.

Character Type Check:
Presence of uppercase letters.
Presence of lowercase letters.
Presence of digits.
Presence of special characters.

Common Pattern Check:
Avoidance of sequences like "123", "abc".
Avoidance of common passwords like "password", "qwerty".

Uniqueness Check:
Basic check against a list of common passwords.

2.Scoring System:
Initial score set to zero.
Increment score for meeting each criterion.
Deduct points for failing criteria or using common patterns.
Final score determines the strength of the password.

3.Feedback Mechanism:
Generates feedback messages to guide the user in improving their password.
Specific feedback for each unmet criterion.
Highlights the importance of avoiding common patterns and using a variety of character types.
